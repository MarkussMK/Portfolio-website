Welcome to my interactive portfolio! This site is designed as a gamified experience, showcasing my skills, projects, and achievements in a modern, engaging format.

## 🚀 Features
- **Progression System:** Earn XP and level up as you explore each section.
- **Unified Popups:** All unlocks and level-ups use a single notification system.
- **Achievements:** Track your progress and unlock system achievements.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for desktop and mobile devices.
- **Minimalistic Animations:** Smooth transitions, including a black screen intro.
- **Contact & Social:** Modern contact form and social media links.

## 📄 Pages
- `index.html` — Main Terminal (Home, About, System Origins)
- `Experience.html` — System Specs (Skills, Profile)
- `Projects.html` — Data Archives (Project Showcase)
- `Contact.html` — Communication Hub (Contact Form, Social)

## 🗂️ Key Files
- `progression.js` — XP, leveling, unlocks, popups
- `animations.js` — UI animations
- `styles.css` & `game-styles-new.css` — Main and game styles
- `aboutmesection.jpg`, `aboutmesection1.jpg`, `aboutmesection2.jpg`, `linkedin.jpg`, `pfp.jpg` — Images used in profile and sections

## 🛠️ How It Works
- **XP System:** Scroll through sections to earn XP. Completing a page gives a bonus to reach the next level.
- **Leveling:** Levels are capped per page; you can't skip levels by earning excess XP.
- **Mobile:** XP tracker appears as a popup only on level-up.
- **Reset Progress:** Use the reset button to clear all progress and return to the main page.

## 💡 Customization
- All content, images, and styles can be easily updated in their respective files.
- Add new achievements or sections by following the structure in the HTML and JS files.
